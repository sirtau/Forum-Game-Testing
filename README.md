## How to Play
Log in, select a character and play the game! 

## Planning

Outline:  
Create an RPG using SQL and Javascript that lets people log in and have their own characters  
Browser-based game that pulls data from database and updates it as needed  

Database:  
'Users':  
 Tracks unique User ID, username, email and password.  
'Characters':  
Tracks character info  
Users.id = Characters.owner_id for tracking/validation  



## My Experience Developing the Game

Started building things with mainly Ruby for planning as proof of concepts. Found a good balance between JS and Ruby to code the project

Learned a lot about combining technologies to make one cohesive application. 

Learned kaboom.js


## TO DO - LOTS
Continue game logic code and menus  
Turn based/random battles? Real time? (Likely to remain turn based)  
levelling/xp logic  
Inventory  
Shop  
Item use  
quests  
Spells  
Message Board  
Friends list (With online/offline status?)
